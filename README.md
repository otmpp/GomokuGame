# University - Project
This is the gomoku game I made for my final project in Year 2 of my Mathematics Degree. It is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe but played on an 8x8 grid, with players aiming to align five pieces

-	Key Features:
    -	Enabled player vs. player, player vs. AI, and AI vs. AI modes.

    -	Created a save/load feature to allow ongoing games to be resumed.
        -	Creating, opening and closing files to read and write to them, modules
